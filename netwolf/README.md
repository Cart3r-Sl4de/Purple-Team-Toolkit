# NetWolf

A delightful little project that is practically NetCat Cybersecurity tool, which inspired code written in [Black Hat Python](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hat-Python-2nd-Programming/dp/1718501129/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=black+hat+python) written by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold., in chapter 2.

I wanted to write this so I could have tangible experience writing code and producing programs in the field of Cybersecurity, and this code from NetCat and the aforementioned book helped give me a first step into it!

Over time there may be further features added, for now I wish to see it work as initially intended.

Thank you kindly for reading!
